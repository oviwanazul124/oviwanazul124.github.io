It been a while when I posted, but I worked in some updates in the blog first of all **NOW THE BLOG POST WILL BE TRANSLATED**, right now the only translated is the Leibniz's Algorithm but I will work to update the other posts. To what languages I'm going to translate it?. Well....

## Spanish

It's my native language so it is relatively easy to translate my post to that language.

## English

You are reading it right now, I'm going to still publish content in English, and it will be accesible to all of you

## Japanese and German

Yes, both of them, German will be included in the blog around Winter of 2025 (I'm still learning the basics...) and Japanese is now being translated but may be some errors, I'm still learning the syntax of the language (Maybe I would do a Blog post about it), if you find errors, contact me!. I will solve any problem there is in your native language, I'm translating this post to this language to learn more about both of them.
