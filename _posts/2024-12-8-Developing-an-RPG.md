## Introduction

In this series of blog posts, we will view how to develop an RPG game in Godot. There are many engines that we can use to create a video game, **Unity**, and **Unreal Engine** but we are going to choose **Godot** for the following reasons.

## Why Godot?

Godot is an **open-source engine that is free to use**. You can donate to its development, but if you are really starting out in this world as a hobby, it is one of the **best engines** that you can start with.

Everything is not perfect **there are some cons** to this, for example, the community is still a bit tiny so it would be **more difficult** to view more **specifics tutorials** and you will need to refer to the **documentation**. Also, Godot **uses his language named GDScript**, which shares some similarities to Python, Ruby, and others.

## Installing the engine

### From main website

To install the engine we can do it in two ways, the first one is to do it from the official website, you enter the website and press the download button, you only run the executable and you have installed the engine.

### From online stores

The second way is via online stores like Steam, itch.io, or Epic Games Store, you only need to search and install it.

Here you will set **the name of the project**, and **where is going to be saved the** project. There is also a selection about the render of the project, for now we will select **Forward+** and click in **create and edit**.
