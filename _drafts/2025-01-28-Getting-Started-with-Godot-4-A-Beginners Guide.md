### What is this post about?

---

In this blog post we are going to focus on explaining the basics of how to program in godot in a very basic way. I will explain everything in a way that can be understood by a person coming from another engine or someone who is just starting his journey.

###  GDScript

---

The first big difference we have in the language, in this tutorial we will focus on GDScript, there are great C# tutorials all over the internet, and although you can get the same results with both some things are much simpler in this language as we will see soon.


### Comments in Godot

---

One of the most basics in any language is to comment code, commenting code works to give notes about how it works or task for other members in your team. To comment in godot you need to use **#**

```gdscript

# This is a comment in Godot 4.0!

```

#### Keywords in comment 

---

> The rest of the comments sections is exclusive to the GDScript built-in editor, this may work in others editor but not in all.
{: .prompt-warning}


If you use the built-in editor, you can use some keywords to highlight this comments. For example if you use: **ALERT**, **WARNING**, **INFO** will appear in different color in the built-in editor.

> There is more of this type of "special keywords", if you want to know more about it go to the official [documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#comments)
{: .prompt-info}

#### Code Regions

Also 

### Variables

---

The most basic thing that we are going to observe is how to define a variable, so that we understand the term **variable**, it is a small box in which we can store certain information. For example if we wanted to save the life of a player we would define a variable to save it.


Next we are going to talk about the different types of variables: 

- [**Bool**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#bool): An Boolean is a type of variable that store a **"True"** or **"False"** value. This is used for example if we want to check if an enemy is alive or not. To understand how it works we are going to program an example

#### Bool Example

---

- [**Int**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#int): An int is a type of variable that stores a entire number, for exmaple: **3** or **345** **-574**. This can be used for example to store the money that the player have

#### Int Example

---

- [**Float**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#float): An float is a type of variable that a stores a decimal number, for example: **3.14159** or **2.71828**. This 

#### Float Example

---

- [**String**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#string):

#### String Example

After viewing all the variables we are going to develop different example for every variable, the code and the full set up will be given in my **github**[]
